# wine-patches
My local set of wine patches, mostly for running games under OSX. 

Most of these patches are hacks to get around bugs or missing functionality in wine. The focus is on OSX but there
may be patches useful for linux users too.

Most of the hacks are toggleable via registry keys; the goal is to have one single wine engine I can use for all my wineskin
apps instead of having a bunch of app-specific compiled versions. I'll try to keep up with wine development and remove 
anything here that's fixed/no long needed.

There may be some patches here integrated from wine-staging as well.
